# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The provided code attempts to access a user based on an ID passed as a route parameter. However, it lacks proper validation and error handling, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Bug

The primary issue lies in the absence of checks to ensure the `userId` is a valid number before parsing and using it. If a non-numeric value is provided in the URL, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing unexpected results or potentially throwing an error further down the processing chain.

## Solution

The solution adds validation to check if `userId` is a valid integer before proceeding. It also includes comprehensive error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and informative messages in case of errors.
